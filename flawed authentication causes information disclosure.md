1. Suppress Stack Traces in Production: The most critical immediate fix is to configure the application (or web server/proxy) to never display detailed stack traces to end-users in a production environment. Instead, a generic error message (e.g., "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.") should be shown, and the full traceback should only be logged securely on the server side for debugging by developers.
2. Fix UnboundLocalError: The developer needs to correct the Python code on line 61 of apis.py by properly importing or defining status (e.g., from rest_framework import status at the top of the file, or using HTTPStatus.BAD_REQUEST if using standard library's http module).
3. Review CSRF Implementation: While not the primary error, the "CSRF check failed" message should prompt a review of the CSRF protection to ensure it's robust and not susceptible to bypasses.
In conclusion, while the UnboundLocalError is a coding bug, its exposure through the stack trace is an information disclosure vulnerability (CWE-209) that significantly aids an attacker's reconnaissance efforts and increases the risk of more targeted and severe attacks.
